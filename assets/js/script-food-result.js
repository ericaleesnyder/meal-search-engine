//food results page uses the user input as the query variable to display recipes on cards

//food results page
//if the user wants a different ingredient, the search tool re-runs the api pull with new query variable
//WHEN search is initiated
//THEN recipe cards are created with an icon to click on for a favorite, name (label), cuisine type, dish type, meal type, a link
//the user can "favorite" a recipe - favorited recipes stored in aside (think weather homework) - and the favorites page gets these variables too
